  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    This grilled salmon tastes so good! A simple soy sauce and brown sugar
    marinade, with hints of lemon and garlic, are the perfect salty-sweet
    complement to rich salmon fillets. Even my 9-year-old loves this recipe!
    Serve with a side of grilled zucchini or grilled corn.
